   *
   * - It must hand back the *same array* when nothing was removed. A fresh array notifies, and the
   *   writeback then pushes this mirror over the control's own selection, erasing the pick that
   *   prompted the notification in the first place.
   * - A genuine removal takes the control's whole selection rather than filtering this mirror down
   *   to it. The two differ while a pick is unconfirmed — the mirror is the smaller of the pair —
   *   and writing that subset back would drop the unconfirmed pick out of the control along with
   *   the chip that was actually dismissed. Adopting the selection keeps the control intact, at
   *   the cost of arming Assign over a pick whose dropdown never closed; the control is showing
   *   that pick as selected, so the button agrees with the field either way.
